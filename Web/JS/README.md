#### _Write-up_

In this challenge I was given JS_7611038f48adf601c6d5799a2a61eec6.html file. I use Sublime Text to view the contain of the file. I fail to decode the string given. So, I use bandicam to record the animation display on the browser and using MPC-HC open source media player to see the flag by using slow motion.

#### The flag of this challenge is uniklctf20{Y0u_h4V3__l34Rn_aB0ut_d3BugGinG}
